Freedom means not having a master. And in the area of computing, freedom means not using proprietary software.&quot;&#10;-Richard M. Stallman&#10;&#10;&quot;If you want to build an open source project, you can't let your ego stand in the way. You can't rewrite everybody's patches, you can't second-guess everybody, and you have to give people equal control.&quot;&#10;-Rasmus Lerdorf&#10;&#10;&quot;I think, fundamentally, open source does tend to be more stable software. It's the right way to do things.&quot;&#10;-Linus Torvalds&#10;&#10;“If programmers deserve to be rewarded for creating innovative programs, by the same token they deserve to be punished if they restrict the use of these programs.”&#10;-Richard M.
